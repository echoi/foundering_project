Sources of stress responsible for earthquakes occurring in the Central and Eastern US (CEUS) must include not only far-field plate boundary forces but also various local contributions. In this study, we model stress distributions due to heterogeneities in the upper mantle beneath the CEUS including a high-velocity feature identified as a lithospheric root in a recent regional P wave tomography study. We convert the P-wave velocities into a temperature field \annote[EC]{and get the corresponding viscosity field using temperature-dependent dislocation and diffusion creep rheology.}{How do you deal with strain rate-dependency of these rheologies?} We retrieve velocity and stress fields from instantaneous 3D numerical models that take the converted temperature and viscosity fields as inputs. \remove[EC]{We isolate all the heterogeneity deeper than 200 km in one model setup and additionally, we isolate the effects of a high-density feature interpreted as lithospheric root in another.} When only the shallow ($<$ 200 km) mantle heterogeneities are included in a model,differential and Coulomb stress at the \annote[EC]{optimal fault orientations}{with respect to the regional SHmax orientation?} showed greater magnitudes in the seismic zones than in other regions. The model with only the lithospheric root \add[EC]{and homogeneous shallow mantle} revealed that the root has the stress concentration effects only on the root's vicinity including the Eastern Tennessee Seismic Zone and the northeast arm of the New Madrid Seismic Zone. \annote[EC]{We also calculate the Coulomb stress from our models at a range of theoretical fault orientations and dips.}{Shorten this sentence and instead include what was found from the calculations.} Our modeling results suggest that the upper mantle heterogenities below the CEUS has stress concentration effects and are likely to promote earthquake generation at preexisting faults in the region's seismic zones. %Moreover, these heterogeneities increase the Coulomb stress at preexisting faults in the seismic zones, generating earthquakes.

\section{Introduction}
     
    The tectonic setting of the Central and Eastern US (CEUS) includes complex fault systems formed by two continent-scale episodes of rifting and collision~\citep[e.g.,][]{keller1983role, hoffman1989precambrian, thomas2006tectonic}. Within these systems, optimally oriented faults with respect to the present-day regional or local stresses can get reactivated, generating earthquakes~\citep[e.g.,][]{zoback1992stress, hurd2012intraplate}. Indeed, the CEUS is characterized by several intraplate seismic zones including the New Madrid Seismic Zone (NMSZ), the Eastern Tennessee Seismic Zone (ETSZ), the South Carolina Seismic Zone (SCSZ), the Giles County Seismic Zone (GCSZ) and the Central Virginia Seismic Zone (CVSZ) (Fig.~\ref{figone}). 
    
    Far from the tectonic plate boundaries and known to have low tectonic strain rates~\citep{Boyd_2015}, the CEUS appears to require local stress contributions to earthquake generation in the active seismic zones. Diverse origins of these local stress perturbations have been proposed, many of which involve both crustal and upper mantle heterogeneity. \citet{Kenner_2000a} proposed the presence of a weaker lower crustal zone within an elastic lithosphere that acts as a local source of stress concentration. \citet{Pollitz_2001} suggested a geodynamic model for the NMSZ consisting of a sinking mafic body in the weakened lower crust that can transfer stress into the overlying elastic crust. \citet{levandowski2016dense} showed that stress produced by a high density lower crust below the NMSZ interferes constructively with the far-field tectonic stress causing optimal stress orientations for earthquake generation.  Although the seismogenic depths in the CEUS occur in the upper to middle crust (5 to 30 km) \citep{vlahovic1998et1d, johnston1996seismic, mazzotti2010state}, deeper mantle structures can also make a significant contribution to the stress generation of  earthquakes~\citep[e.g.,][]{forte2007descent, li2007stress, chen2014crust, nyamwandha2016joint, zhan2016stress}. \citet{forte2007descent} showed that stress concentration below the NMSZ could be produced by the descent of the Farallon slab using a global geodynamic and seismic tomography based numerical model. \citet{li2007stress} showed that lateral heterogeneity in the lithosphere below the CEUS could concentrate stress. \citet{chen2014crust} and \citet{nyamwandha2016joint} independently observed a low P-wave velocity zone at 50-200 km depths below the NMSZ. This was interpreted as a weak zone which acts as a conduit for stress transfer into the crust. \citet{zhan2016stress} determined that higher upper mantle temperatures, based on a regional tomography model by~\citet{pollitz2014seismic}, will focus stress in the NMSZ crust.

%Several past studies focusing on the NMSZ have suggested that the crustal structure of this seismic zone causes stress concentration~\citep{Kenner_2000a, Pollitz_2001, levandowski2016dense}. \citet{Kenner_2000a} proposed the presence of a weaker lower crustal zone within an elastic lithosphere that acts as a local source of stress concentration. \citet{Pollitz_2001} suggested a geodynamic model for NMSZ consisting of a sinking mafic body in the weakened lower crust that can transfer stress into the overlying elastic crust. \citet{levandowski2016dense} showed that a high density lower crust below the NMSZ interferes constructively with the far-field tectonic stress causing optimal stress orientations for earthquake generation.
    
Similar considerations of crustal and mantle stress sources are yet to be made for other CEUS seismic zones such as the ETSZ, SCSZ, GCSZ, and CVSZ. In a recent high-resolution P-wave tomography study, \citet{Biryol_2016} found positive velocity anomalies in the upper mantle beneath the area in-between the ETSZ and the NMSZ at depths of 200 to 660 km, and interpreted them as foundering lithosphere. They further speculated that, since the NMSZ and ETSZ coincide with the boundary of lithosphere thinned by the delamination, they are weakened by the underlying hot asthenosphere and thus prone to seismicity. 

In this study, we investigate the effects of the upper mantle heterogeneities found in the P-wave tomography study by~\citet{Biryol_2016} on the seismicity in the CEUS. We compute stress fields arising from density and strength variations converted from the tomography using instantaneous three-dimensional (3D) mantle flow models. %explaining the location of seismic zones and assessing the sources of their initiation \citep{zoback1992stress, king1994static, stein1999role, bowman2001accelerating}. 
Following previous studies that have demonstrated it to be useful to correlate differential stress~\citep[e.g.,][]{baird2010relationship, zhan2016stress}) and deviatoric stress ~\citep[e.g.,][]{levandowski2016dense}) with the observed intraplate seismicity, 
% These stress indicators are useful for  observing the stress distribution within the brittle crust. 
we will consider contributions of the upper mantle heterogeneity to these stress fields and discuss the slip tendency of faults in the seismic zones based on the Coulomb failure criterion~\citep[e.g.,][]{king1994static, freed2005earthquake, li2007stress}. 


\section{Seismic tomography \add[EC]{and upper mantle heterogeneities}}
\note[EC]{I understand your concern from your experience with the first paper but these descriptions really looks like we are doing homework for Byriol et al. They are probably useful when you present this study somewhere. Any way, let's focus on describing what was imaged.}
We briefly summarize the seismic tomography results by \citet{Biryol_2016} including the associated resolution and uncertainties before explaining our numerical models and results. The tomography study by \citet{Biryol_2016} is based on direct P and PKPdf residual travel times for the IASP91 earth model \citep{kennett1991traveltimes}. The data is collected from 514 stations in the study region (Fig. \ref{figone}) for 753 teleseismic earthquakes occurring between 2011 to 2015 with moment magnitude, $Mw > 5.5$. The discretized model has a lateral extent of 30 km in the center and 45 km along the boundary of the domain. The depth extent of the grid is from 36 km to 915 km and consists of 21 layers, but we are only interested in the features extending down to 660 km for this study. The tomographic inversion algorithm by \citet{schmandt2010seismic} is used along with optimal smoothing and damping constraints to minimize the model norm and data misfit (described in detail in the supplementary information by \citet{Biryol_2016}). Only model nodes with high quality (hit points) are used, and therefore, only model results deeper than 60 km depth are interpreted by them.
    
    \citet{Biryol_2016} verify their inversion results after robust resolution tests. The checkerboard and synthetic anomaly recovery tests indicate vertical smearing at shallow depths due to the near vertical incidence of the teleseismic raypaths and amplitude loss by about 40 \% in the center of the model. Their calculated lateral resolution in the center is about 40 km going to 60 km towards the bottom of the domain while the vertical resolution  is around 50 km at the top and extends to 65 km at the bottom. They observe some artifacts due to smearing but have overall confidence on the large magnitude ($>$1 \%) and dimensional features. The locations of the smaller dimensional features ($\sim$100 km) are recovered in the synthetic resolution tests, but their outline is smeared laterally and vertically. The well- sampled region in the tomographic inversion after synthetic tests along with the high-velocity anomaly (mean amplitude of 1.9 \%), interpreted as lithospheric foundering, is shown in Fig. \ref{fig_tomo}. It is noted that this feature starts at an approximate depth $\sim$ 200 km with lateral dimensions of $1^\circ$ and extends to 660 km where it widens to about $3^\circ$. Because of its large amplitude and dimensions, the foundering lithospheric root is well resolved in their synthetic anomaly tests and therefore, reliable for our numerical model inputs.

\section{Methodology}
    Inputs for a mantle flow model include temperature and density fields converted from the velocity anomalies with the effects of anelasticity, compositional variations, and phase changes taken into account. The effective rheology is assumed to be a combination of diffusion and dislocation creep. To make a meaningful interpretation of the presence of deep heterogeneity, we use a reference model with laterally homogeneous temperatures at depths $>$ 200 km. \add[EC]{Models with heterogeneous temperature and density fields are constructed and compared with the reference one in terms of differential stress and Coulomb stress changes for selected values of fault strike and dip.} \remove[EC]{Since we are interested in the effects of the high-velocity anomalies interpreted as foundering (Biryol et al., 2016)} We also examine dynamic topography \remove[EC]{caused by the mantle flow }induced by the sinking denser material. 
    
\subsection{Temperature Calculations} \label{temp_var}
    \note[EC]{The first sentence gives an impression that the nature of and difficulties associated with the non-linearity would follow. I can only guess your intention but the thesis sentence would have to something like ``Temperature anomalies are converted from the seismic tomography results based on the non-linear inversion procedure used by Cammarano et al. (2003).''} Converting seismic tomography results for the mantle to a temperature field is commonly regarded as a non-linear problem due to the shear anelasticity of seismic waves \citep{minster1981model, karato1993importance, sobolev1996upper, Goes_2000, artemieva2004shear} and non-linear sensitivity of elastic moduli and their pressure derivatives to temperature \citep{duffy1989seismic, anderson1992high, Cammarano2003, stixrude2005thermodynamics}. The presence of melt or water may also introduce non-linearity in temperature effects on seismic velocities~\citep{Karato_1998} but these effects are not considered in this study for simplicity and lack of high heat flow and other substantial evidence for melting in this region of the  mantle~\citep{blackwell2006assessment}. We follow the approach given by \citet{Cammarano2003} to calculate temperature given the velocity anomalies incorporating the effects of anharmonicity \annote[EC]{(composition)}{What do you mean? anharmonicity stems from non-uniform composition? Or does it depend on composition? Or something else?} (\ref{anh}), anelasticity (\ref{anel}) and the phase transition at 410 km depth. The calculated temperatures and the corresponding velocity anomalies at depths of 200 km and 605 km are shown in Fig. \ref{fig_temp}. We describe our calculations in detail in Appendix A. 
%
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{figures/figure_temp.png}
    \caption{Temperatures (right) at depths of 200 and 605 km calculated from P wave anomalies (left) accounting for compositional variations, attenuation and the phase transformation at 410 km. Black dotted line marks the probable boundary of the high-velocity structure interpreted as a foundering root by \citet{Biryol_2016}, see Fig. \ref{fig_model} for a detailed structure outline.}
    \label{fig_temp}
 \end{figure}

Our approach has several differences from that of~\citet{Cammarano2003}. Firstly, we invert velocity anomalies, not absolute velocities, for temperature anomalies to be added to an assumed reference geotherm $T_o$. \annote[EC]{Our results involve errors due to uncertainties in the reference geotherm, but the geotherm is sufficient to evaluate the heterogeneity in the temperature since the same error propagates laterally.}{I don't see need for stating this.} Secondly, we use the Voigt \annote[EC]{(constant strain)}{What does this mean?} averaging scheme to calculate elastic moduli and density of the composite rock instead of the Hashin Shtrikman scheme\add[EC]{used by Cammarano et al.(2003)?}. Although the Voigt scheme is known to overestimate the converted values~\citep{watt_1976}, seismic velocities based on compositions averaged by the Voigt (upper bound) and the Reuss (lower bound) scheme shows less than 0.2 \% difference in magnitudes. Since this error is within the range of the tomography error \citep{Biryol_2016}, we use the computationally simpler Voigt scheme. Finally, elastic moduli at high pressures are extrapolated using second-order accuracy instead of third-order for simplicity in implementation of the inversion.

\note[EC]{This and the next paragraphs are very dry descriptions of sources of parameter values. I think it should be a part of the appendix.} We use eq.(\ref{anh}) to calculate anharmonic effects on seismic velocity. Bulk modulus (\annote[EC]{K}{These are denoted as $K_{0}$ etc in A.3. Please double-check and be consistent.}), shear modulus (G) and density ($\rho$) for the reference \annote[EC]{mineral}{Mineral or rock?} composition  are taken from~\citet{Cammarano2003}. The \add[EC]{reference?} geotherm ($T_o$) for lithospheric (i.e., $<$ 200 km) depths~\citep{Goes_2002} and for greater depths from~\citet{turcotte2014geodynamics}.Thermal expansivity ($\alpha$) from~\citet{saxena_data} (see Table~\ref{table1}). We assume a reference composition of harzburgite for the craton, i.e., 83 \% olivine (ol), 15 \% orthopyroxene (opx), 2 \% garnet (gt)~\citep{mcdonough1998mineralogy} for depths 40 km to 410 km or pressure (P) $<$ 12.5 GPa. For depths from 410 km to 660 km, we use a reference composition of 60 \% Mg-wadsleyite and 40 \% Majorite~\citep{haggerty1995upper}. We use Burnman, a mineral physics toolbox~\citep{cottaar2014burnman}, to calculate the mantle adiabat with a potential temperature of 1300$^{\circ}$C for P $<$ 12.5 GPa, which is appropriate for continental lithosphere \citep{rudnick1998thermal} and 1600$^{\circ}$ for P $>$ 12.5 GPa~\citep{katsura2010adiabatic}. 

Anelasticity is implemented using the values given by \citet{sobolev1996upper} for their model 2 (pressure dependence on activation enthalpy in calculating attenuation, see \ref{anel}). We use a value of 1 Hz for the frequency in the attenuation calculation. We do not include the effects of melting in attenuation for the reasons discussed earlier.

Both anharmonic and anelastic effects on seismic velocities \remove[EC]{, which are discontinuous at the 410 km phase transition,} are taken into account in our inversion for temperature.\note[EC]{The previous sentence is redundant with the intro paragraph of this section. Probably you don't need it.} The inversion procedure starts with an initial guess for temperature and updates the temperature values using the Newton-Raphson approach at all \annote[EC]{the observational points}{What does this mean?} until the \annote[EC]{difference with the observed seismic anomalies}{I'm confused. Difference between temperqture and seismic anomalies??} is minimized. We also calculate temperatures accounting for uncertainties in the elastic moduli and their temperature derivatives (given in \citet{Cammarano2003}) and compare them with the results obtained here using the mean values given in Table \ref{table1}. Taking the maximum values of the elastic parameters reduces the temperature sensitivity such that the negative (positive) velocity anomaly decreases (increases) temperature by a small ($\pm$ 90 K) magnitude. On the other hand, minimum parameter values increase the temperature sensitivity, and therefore the range of temperatures obtained, by $\sim$ 180 K. 

\subsection{Model Setup}
    \note[EC]{Although a nice summary, this paragraph seems redundant and doesn't fit in the Model Setup section.} We calculate the stress field associated with an instantaneous viscous mantle flow. The mantle flow is driven by thermal buoyancy arising from the heterogeneous temperature distribution converted from the P-wave tomography by \citet{Biryol_2016} as described above. Model inputs, density, and viscosity distributions are computed based on the converted temperatures. 
    
    We use ASPECT version 2.0.0 for the mantle flow and stress calculations~\citep{heister_aspect_methods2,KHB12,aspect-doi-v2.0.0}. ASPECT solves the equations for the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy using finite element method. 
    
     \remove[EC]{The model domain is shown in Fig {\ref{fig_model}}. and the viscosity computed based on the temperature distribution.} The model domain is laterally bounded by longitudes from 71$^{\circ}$W to 95.5$^{\circ}$W and latitudes from 23$^{\circ}$N to 43$^{\circ}$N; and the depth range is from 0 to 660 km (Fig.~\ref{fig_model}). Since the tomography model considers only the mantle starting from a depth of 40 km, we assume homogeneous physical conditions and material properties in the top 40 km-thick crust layer: i.e., temperature, density, and viscosity are 500 $^{\circ}$C, 2900 kg/m$^{3}$, and 5x10$^{24}$Pa$\cdot$s, respectively. Our interest only in mantle stress sources justifies this assumption of a homogeneous crust. The domain is discretized into 0.512 million hexahedral elements for a resolution comparable to that of the tomography. The resultant resolution in each dimension is 0.15$^{\circ}$ in longitude, 0.125$^{\circ}$ in latitude and 35 km in depth. Although the mantle structures seen in the tomography model are well resolved in our geodynamic model with this resolution, we also ran simulations with a finer grid (2.048 million elements). Because differences in the results were small (relative error of 2\%), we consistently used the coarser mesh in this study for computational efficiency.

Upper mantle deformation is usually described by the combination of dislocation creep at lower temperatures than the melting temperatures of the rock and diffusion creep at high temperatures~\citep[e.g.,][]{gordon1967thermally}. Our model employs both dislocation and diffusion creep with each type having different contributions depending on the temperature and pressure, such that the effective viscosity ($\eta_{\text{eff}}$) is computed as~\citep{billen2007rheologic}:
%
\begin{align}
    \eta_{\text{i}} &= \frac{1}{2} A^{-\frac{1}{n_i}} d^\frac{m_i}{n_i} \dot{\varepsilon_i}^{\frac{1-n_i}{n_i}} \exp\left(\frac{E_i + PV_i}{n_iRT}\right),\ i=\text{diff or dis}, \\
    \eta_{\text{eff}} &= \left(\frac{1}{\eta^\text{diff}} + \frac{1}{\eta^\text{dis}}\right)^{-1},
\end{align}
%
where diff and dis denote diffusion and dislocation creep, $A_i$ is the pre-exponential factor, $n_i$ is the power law exponent, $d$ is the grain size, $m_i$ is the grain size exponent, $\dot{\varepsilon}$ is the second invariant of the strain rate tensor, $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is temperature obtained from the inversion of the P-wave anomalies, $P$ is pressure, and $E_i$ and $V_i$ are the activation energy and volume. All the parameter values used in this study are given in Table~\ref{table_model}.

Tthe bottom boundary that coincides with the 660-km discontinuity is a free-slip boundary~\citep[e.g.,][]{arcay2007slab, billen2007rheologic, quinquis2011role}). For lateral boundaries, we tested our model with both free-slip and no-slip conditions and verified that the velocity fields at the seismic zones have the same pattern with up to 5\% magnitude difference. In this study, we only show the results for the no-slip conditions. We let the top boundary be a free surface

that can develop topography in response to the instantaneous flow in the mantle. We test a model with an additional lateral area of 5$^{\circ}$ by 5$^{\circ}$ surrounding our domain to asess boundary effects. The overall resultant velocity and stress field is similar with the smaller model domain, but the magnitude of the calculated stress and velocity field at our depth of interest, i.e. 15 km, near the boundaries is smaller by 10-15 \% as the viscous effect of the same heterogeneity is now spread over a larger area. We show only the results for the smaller domain because the seismic zones are still sufficiently far from the model domain boundaries.

Static changes in Coulomb stress ($\Delta C$) between models are defined as the difference of the Coulomb Failure Function (CFF) values~\citep{king1994static}:
\begin{equation}
    \Delta C = \Delta \tau - \mu' \Delta \sigma_n,
\end{equation}
%
where $\Delta \tau$ (positive in the direction of slip) and $\Delta \sigma_n$ (positive when compressive) are the differences in shear and normal stresses projected onto a particular fault orientation, respectively, and $\mu'$ is the effective coefficient of friction after accounting for pore pressure. Our model results follow \annote[EC]{the right-hand rule}{Need a better description so that the following information can be easily understood. Also, please consider merging the sign convention given in the parentheses above with these.}, such that a negative sign with $\tau$ describes left-lateral and normal fault motion.
% High $\mu$ between 0.5 and 0.8 is associated with \annote[EC]{limited}{What do you mean?} fault cohesion and therefore, \annote[EC]{slip while lower values, i.e. 0-0.5 are generally taken for smooth sealed faults capable of larger slip accumulation}{The meaning of this sentence is not clear to me.} \citep{parsons1999stress}. 
Since we do not have sufficient constraints on the effective friction coefficients for the faults in the study area, we use a value of 0.6 based on the study by~\citet{hurd2012intraplate}. 

We evaluate CFF \annote[EC]{at the approximate locations of the seismic zones}{I thought CFF is evaluated everywhere in the domain. If what you said is the case, the approximate locations should be clearly described or marked on a map.}, ETSZ, SCSZ, CVSZ, GCSZ, and the northeastern arm of the NMSZ (NMSZ\_NE), which are contained in the well-resolved region  in the~\citet{Biryol_2016} tomography.

To facilitate comparison of models with and without the foundering lithosphere delineated by the \note[EC]{velocity or density?} isosurface in Fig.~\ref{fig_model}, we denote the tomography-based model with the foundering lithosphere as HT (heterogeneous), a laterally homogeneous temperature below 200 km depth as HM (homogeneous) and the one identical with HT except that the temperature within the foundering lithosphere is replaced with the reference values as \annote[EC]{HR}{What is being abbreviated?} .

\section{Model results}
We calculate changes in differential ($\Delta|\sigma_1 - \sigma_3|$) and Coulomb stress ($\Delta$ C) in HT relative to HM and HR, denoted by HT$-$HM, HT$-$HR, respectively. HT$-$HM represents the stress contributions from the mantle heterogeneity deeper than 200 km, while HT$-$HR shows only the contribution of the high-velocity structure interpreted as the foundering root. 

Fig. \ref{model_results}(a) shows the computed change in differential stress for HT$-$HM (i.e., $\Delta|\sigma_1 - \sigma_3| = |\sigma_1 - \sigma_3|_{HT} - |\sigma_1 - \sigma_3|_{HM}$) at the seismogenic depth of 15 km for our model~\citep[e.g.,][]{mazzotti2010state}). Large positive values of $\Delta |\sigma_1 - \sigma_3|>15$ MPa are observed at the locations, $F_1$ and $F_2$. The seismic zones, ETSZ, SCSZ, GCSZ, CVSZ, and NMSZ, are overall correlated with positive $\Delta |\sigma_1 - \sigma_3|$ in the range of 2 to 10 MPa (\ref{model_results}b). On the other hand, differential stress changes in HT$-$HR show only a small positive values of 1 to 2 MPa in the horseshoe-shaped region surrounding the root including the ETSZ and NMSZ (\ref{model_results}b).

Coulomb stress changes ($\Delta $C) are computed for HT$-$HM (Fig.~\ref{model_results}c) and HT$-$HR (Fig.~\ref{model_results}d) at 15 km depth with respect to the optimal fault geometry in the five seismic zones (Table \ref{table_fault}).

The heterogeneous HT model produces a stress field that would increase the Coulomb stress in the GCSZ and  NMSZ\_NE by 4-5 MPa and by 1 MPa or less in the ETSZ with respect to the optimal fault orientation within these three seismic zones (Fig. \ref{model_results}c). For the vertical EW left-lateral faults, $\Delta$C$_{HT-HM}$ is as large as 5 MPa in most parts of the ETSZ. $\Delta$C$_{HT-HM}$ for faults with a strike of N$30^\circ$E and a dip of 50$^\circ$ SE with thrust motion shows only about 1-2 MPa increase in the CVSZ. The presence of the mantle heterogeneities does not increase the Coulomb stresses in the SCSZ relative to the homogenous model for optimally oriented faults in that seismic zone, which are thrust faults striking at N$30^\circ$W and dipping $60^\circ$ SE. %, which is the  for shows not much correlation between the seismicity in SCSZ and positive $\Delta $C (Fig. \ref{model_results}(c)). 

The stress field due to the root (HT$-$HR) increases the Coulomb stress by up to 3 MPa in NMSZ\_NE for the seismic zone's optimal fault orientation (Fig. \ref{model_results}d). However, in the other seismic zones with the same optimal fault orientation (ETSZ, and GCSZ), $\Delta $C$_{HT-HR}$ is weakly positive or even negative; the magnitude of $\Delta $C$_{HT-HR}$ is less than 1 MPa in ETSZ, CVSZ, and SCSZ for their respective optimal fault orientations, indicating negligible effects of the root on those seismic zones.

\section{Discussion and Summary}
%    In this study, we investigate the stress effects due to upper mantle heterogeneity, $>$ 200 km depth, and isolated lithospheric instability on the intraplate seismicity of the CEUS using numerical models based on the temperatures calculated from the \citet{Biryol_2016} tomography results. Many possible stress concentrators in the CEUS have been proposed to explain the seismicity \citep[e.g.,][]{levandowski2016dense, zhan2016stress} but analysis done here invoking deeper upper mantle structures and impact collectively on the seismicity in the CEUS has not been done before. 
    
    %We compute changes in differential stress and the Coulomb stress for particular fault orientations in the seismic zones: ETSZ, GCSZ, SCSZ, SCSZ and NMSZ (see Fig. \ref{figone} for their locations) due to both mantle heterogeneity and the lithospheric root in models HT$-$HM and HT$-$HR respectively. We observe 
    The foundering root appears to have an area of influence that includes only the ETSZ and NMSZ; the HT$-$HR case isolates the effects of the root and shows positive changes in differential stress magnitude only in the ETSZ and NMSZ\_NE. On the other hand, the HT$-$HM results involving the combined effects of all the mantle heterogeneities below 200 km indicates that those mantle heterogeneities would increase differential stress relative to a hypothetical homogeneous mantle in all of the seismic zones considered (ETSZ, GCSZ, SCSZ, SCSZ and NMSZ\_NE). 
    
    %The Coulomb stress change is calculated at the selected fault orientations determined from previous studies on focal mechanism and earthquake hypocentral relocation in these seismic zones \citep[e.g.,][]{cooley2015new, powell2016grenville, munsey1985focal, chiu1992imaging}. In HT$-$HM, ETSZ, GCSZ and northeastern arm of NMSZ show an increase in Coulomb stress for the proposed fault orientation in these regions and CVSZ shows a weak positive increase while SCSZ overlies in the stress shadow, i.e. negative Coulomb stress change. Conversely, HT$-$HR does not show strong correlation between seismiciy and the Coulomb stress increase at all seismic zones except NMSZ.
    
     We quantify the optimal fault orientation for failure based only on our model results by calculating the Coulomb stress changes in the seismic zones for a wide range of fault geometries: strikes from N$30^\circ$W to N$90^\circ$E, dips from $10^\circ$ SE to $90^\circ$% at intervals of $10^\circ$, for 
     for all the possible slip directions (right-lateral, left-lateral strike-slip, normal and thrust faulting). Results for HT$-$HM are shown in Fig. \ref{cs_ht_hm} and those for HT$-$HR in Fig. \ref{cs_ht_hr}. We restrict our fault orientations between E-W and NNW-SSE because the orientations of the faults in the seismic zones are confined within this range according to previous studies~\citep{shumway2008focal, hurd2012intraplate, johnson2014earthquake, cooley2015new}. Since the effects of the root are spatially limited to the ETSZ and the NMSZ (Fig. \ref{cs_ht_hr}) and are smaller in magnitude compared to HT$-$HM (Fig. \ref{cs_ht_hm}), we identify the most optimally orientated fault plane as the orientation and sense of motion where $\Delta$C$_{HT-HM}$ is maximized.

\end{figure}

     The most optimally oriented fault planes in Fig. \ref{cs_ht_hm} based on our model results do not coincide with the proposed fault focal mechanism solutions in the seismic zones. There are several reasons for the mismatch. Firstly, the presence of deeper ($>$ 200 km) mantle heterogeneity is not the only contributing factor for stress concentration in the CEUS. Other factors such as a dense sinking body in a weak lower crust as proposed by \citet{Pollitz_2001} or weak lower crust embedded in an elastic lithosphere by \citet{Kenner_2000a} or glacial isostatic response from deglaciation of Laurentia by ~\citet{Grollimund_2001}, may also play a role at a shallower depths.  Secondly, most of the earthquakes in the CEUS occur at depths $<$ 20 km~\citep[e.g.,][]{bollinger1985seismicity, chiu1992imaging, powell2016grenville} on reactivated faults formed from one or two episodes of Wilson cycles~\citep{thomas2006tectonic, wolin2012mineral}. The mantle tomography model in our study does not provide constraints on the geometry and strength of the shallow seismogenic faults created in the past. Thirdly, our model does not account for any tectonic stresses and only focuses on the local stress perturbations from the upper mantle. In reality, the effects of plate motion, as included by~\citet{zhan2016stress} and \citet{levandowski2016dense}, will influence the near-surface stress field. All these factors together or alone could change results for all or any of the seismic zones. The important result of our study is the increase in the Coulomb stress in the active CEUS seismic zones due to the presence of the upper mantle heterogeneity.

    \caption{Velocity field at slice AA' (marked in Fig \ref{fig_model}) overlying the viscosity distribution computed from the temperatures based on the tomography by \citet{Biryol_2016}. High-velocity vectors observed west of the NMSZ are from the upward return flow due to the downward pull of the lithospheric root and is likely an artifact due to fixed boundary conditions at the sides.}
    \label{velocity_pattern}
\end{figure}

    The stresses in our model arise from instantaneous flow due to the upper mantle heterogeneity. Fig. \ref{velocity_pattern} shows the velocity field at slice AA$^{\prime}$ (marked in Fig \ref{fig_model}) in the model HT due to heterogeneous density computed from temperatures based on the tomography study by \citet{Biryol_2016}. A downward velocity flow pattern is found below both the NMSZ and ETSZ and the corresponding upwellings induced by it are concentrated along the edges of the model domain. The upwellings are observed at the surface as features F$_1$ and F$_2$ marked in Fig.~\ref{model_results}. The downward flow pattern beneath the NMSZ due to the lithospheric root is opposite to the asthenospheric upwelling proposed by \citet{Biryol_2016}. However, the interpretation of the velocity field from our model depends on various parameters, including the viscosity of the asthenosphere, and boundary conditions of the model. %We computed mantle viscosity solely based on the seismic tomography constraints and the actual value in the earth would be different. 
    Lower viscosity in the asthenosphere would reduce the lateral extent of the convection from the lithospheric root such that the surrounding NMSZ is not affected by the downward pull. However, even with lower viscosity of the asthenosphere it is still unlikely that the bouyancy effects produced by the localized low-velocity anomaly below NMSZ (Fig. \ref{fig_tomo}) would counteract the downward pull from the much more significant positive anomaly lithospheric root.

% \note[EC]{What is the topographic relief in the study area? It must not be as large as $\pm$2000 m. If so, I'm not sure if it's reasonable that the residual topo has a greater relief than the surface... Maybe but what would be the meaning...?}
    We examine the topography generated due to the mantle flow generated from the upper mantle heterogeneity in Fig. \ref{topo_res}. We calculated residual topography in our study region following the approach by \citet{becker2014static} for the static and dynamic topography for the western US. We first calculate the isostatic topography. We use CRUST1.0~\citep{laske2013update} for crustal thickness and density (Fig. \ref{topo_res} a) and LITHO1.0~\citep{pasyanos2014litho1} for lithospheric thickness variations (Fig. \ref{topo_res}b). We assume a constant lithospheric density of 3300 kg/m$^3$ and a constant asthenosphere density of 3250 kg/m$^3$. These values are reasonable for a density contrast between the lithosphere and asthenosphere~\citep[e.g.,][]{bonnardot2008numerical, ito2011probing}. Although the crustal contribution to the topography is 2.25 times more dominant than the lithosphere for these density values, the residual topography is dominated by the lithospheric variations (Fig. \ref{topo_res}c) which are up to 8 times greater than the crustal thickness variations. We also calculate the residual topography from the mantle flow in our models due to the density distribution based on the \citet{Biryol_2016} tomography results (Fig. \ref{topo_res}d). The discrepancy between the topography calculated using global crustal and lithosphere models and that based on the regional seismic tomography is expected. Firstly, the seismic tomography puts no constraints on the crustal structure, and the crust is assumed to have a uniform thickness of 40 km to calculate the isostatic response, contrary to the crustal thickness and density variations obtained from the CRUST1.0 model. Secondly, the LITHO1.0 model is about eight times coarser in resolution than the tomography study, and we assumed a constant density of 3300 kg/m$^3$ instead of the density based on the heterogeneous temperature. We suggest that continued investigation into accurate crustal and lithospheric thickness and density variations is required to observe any topography response from the upper mantle flow.
%

    
    We discuss the stress implications of lithospheric foundering using instantaneous models with a root. Time dependent modeling will be needed to address the mechanism for the origin of a foundering root in the CEUS. Such an investigation in this region would call for more sophisticated techniques such as backward advection modeling~\citep[e.g.,][]{conrad2003seismic}, quasi-reversibility~\citep{glivsovic2016new}, or adjoint methods~\citep[e.g.,][]{bunge2003mantle, liu2008reconstructing} for the calculation of initial conditions on temperature, viscosity and density, which has not been done in this study. It has been proposed by \cite{Biryol_2016} that the lithospheric foundering could have started due to Rayleigh-Taylor instability beginning from the presence of an ecologized root as proposed by \citet{le2006mantle} in the western US. It is also possible that the dense high velocity mantle feature is part of the subducted Farallon slab below this region~\citep{schmandt2010seismic}. We do not comment on the origin of this high-velocity feature but follow the naming convention by \citet{Biryol_2016} as root in this study. Additional observations such as low dynamic topography at the surface would be required to confirm if the high velocity is indeed attached to the lithosphere or part of a remnant Farallon slab.
    
    In summary, based on the numerical model with heterogeneous temperature, density, and viscosity based on the tomography study by \citet{Biryol_2016}, we observe differential stress concentration due to the upper mantle heterogeneity at the major seismic zones in the CEUS: ETSZ, NMSZ, GCSZ, CVSZ, and parts of SCSZ. We also examine the isolated effect of a positive P-wave velocity anomaly interpreted by \citet{Biryol_2016} as a lithospheric root and observe increased differential stress in the seismic zones surrounding the root (ETSZ and NMSZ). Coulomb stress was also increased in the ETSZ, GCSZ, NMSZ, and CVSZ at their optimal fault orientations obtained from other studies when all the upper mantle heterogeneity is considered. Therefore, our results provide a possible mechanism for reactivation of the faults in the intraplate seismicity of the CEUS. This, in turn, helps to better associate seismic hazard with the seismic zones in the CEUS.

The effects of composition at high temperature and pressure are incorporated in seismic velocity following \citet{Cammarano2003} in which the elastic moduli ($K$, $G$) and densities ($\rho$) at reference temperature $T_0$ and pressure $P_0$ are first extrapolated at high temperatures ($T$) and then adiabatically at high pressures ($P$) following finite-strain extrapolation \citep{duffy1989seismic}. The calculations are divided at pressures $~$12.5 GPa to account for phase transformation of olivine to $\beta$ spinel at 410 km. 

To calculate density at high pressures, a mantle adiabat with potential temperature ($T_{pot}$) $1300^o C$ was chosen for depths $\leq$ 410 km and $1600^o C $ for deeper depths up to 660 km. Strain ($\epsilon$) is first calculated at known pressures (based on PREM model by \citet{dziewonski1981preliminary}) using $K_0$, $G_0$ and their pressure derivatives, $K_S'$, $G'$  (Table \ref{table1}).  Reference density calculated at the potential temperature and zero pressure ($\rho(T_{pot}, P_0)$) is then used to get the density $\rho (P,T)$.

\begin{align*} 
    P &=  - (1 - 2\epsilon)^{5/2} \left( 3K_0 \epsilon + \frac{1}{2} ( 9K_0 ( 4 - K_S' )) \epsilon^2 \right),\\
    \epsilon &=  \frac{1}{2} \left[ 1 - \left( \frac{\rho(T,P)}{\rho(T_{pot}, P_0)} \right) ^{2/3} \right]\\
    \rho(T_{pot}, P_0) &=  \rho(T_0, P_0) \text{exp} \left( - \int_{T_0}^{T_{pot}} \alpha (T) dT \right)
\end{align*}
where thermal expansivity, $\alpha(T) = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 T$ is truncated after the second term. Density changes due to temperature, $T$ from the reference geotherm, $T_o$ and pressure are calculated from above as:

\begin{equation}\label{den_der}
    \delta \rho = \rho(T_0, P_0) \text{exp} \left( - \int_{T_0}^{T} \alpha (T') dT' \right) \alpha(T) ) (T - T_o)
\end{equation}

Temperature dependence on $K$ $G$, is assumed linear while changes in $K_S'$, $G'$ is calculated from the procedure in \citep{duffy1989seismic} as: 

\begin{align*} 
    \delta M\vert_{T, P0} &= \frac{\partial M}{\partial T }  ( T - T_o )\\
    \delta M'\vert_{T, P_0} &=  \left( M'(T_0) \text{exp} \left[ \int_{T_0}^{T} \alpha (T) dT \right] \alpha(T) \right) ( T - T_o )  ,
\end{align*}
where $M$ is either $K$ or $G$, $\delta M$, $\delta M'$ are changes in elastic modulus and its  pressure derviate due to temperature $T$.

Elastic moduli changes are then evaluated at high pressures using second-order extrapolation order expansion \citep{duffy1989seismic}:

\begin{align} \label{M_der}
    \delta K + \frac{4}{3} \delta G &= ( 1 - 2 \epsilon)^{5/2} \left[ M_1 + \epsilon \left( 5 L_1 - 3 \frac{\partial K}{\partial T }  ( T - T_o ) \left[ K' + \frac{4}{3} G' \right] - 3K_0 M_2 \right)  \right], \\

    M_1 &= \delta K\vert_{T, P0} + \frac{4}{3}\delta G\vert_{T, P0} ; \hspace{0.5cm}
    M_2 = \delta K'\vert_{T, P_0} + \frac{4}{3}\delta G'\vert_{T, P_0} \nonumber
\end{align}

The anharmonic velocity variations due to temperature and pressure are then calculated using \ref{den_der}, \ref{M_der} for each mineral and then averaged using Voigt (constant strain) averaging scheme for the reference composition, discontinuous across 410 km,  described in section \ref{temp_var}.

\begin{equation} \label{anh}
    \delta V \vert_{anh} = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{K_0 + 4/3 G_0} \sqrt{\rho_0}} \left[\delta K + \frac{4}{3} \delta G \right] - \frac{K_0 + 4/3 G_0}{1\rho_0^{3/2}} ( \delta \rho)
\end{equation} 

Frequency dependence (anelasticity) of velocity with temperature is incorporated following \citet{Goes_2000}:

\begin{align} \label{anel}
    \delta V \vert_{anel} &= Q_p^{-1} \frac{aH}{2 R T^2 \tan(\pi a/2)},\\
    Q_p^{-1} &= A \omega^{a} \exp \left[ \frac{a(H+PV)}{RT} \right] \frac{3Vp_{0}^{2}}{4Vs_{0}^{2}} \nonumber
\end{align}
Here, $\omega = 2\pi $, values of laboratory constants, $a = 0.15, A = 0.148$, activation energy $H = 500$ kJ/mol, volume $V = 20$ cm$^3$/mol are taken from \citet{sobolev1996upper}. $Vs_0$ and $Vp_0$ are S and P wave velocities from IASP91 \citep{kennett1991traveltimes}.

 Although the stress distribution overlies the seismicity well, our numerical models for the stress computations are only constrained by the temperature conversions from the seismic tomography results by \citet{Biryol_2016} and any errors in the calculated temperature will be transmitted to viscosity and to our stress calculations.
